Description: Container-based Debian package builder
 Build Debian packages using overlay FS and systemd namespace containers
 conbuilder creates a base filesystem using debootstrap, then
 overlays it with a filesystem to install the required dependencies
 and finally runs the build on another overlay.
 Layers are created, reused and purged automatically to achieve
 fast package builds while minimizing disk usage.
 conbuilder also allows you to selectively disable networking,
 system calls and capabilities.
